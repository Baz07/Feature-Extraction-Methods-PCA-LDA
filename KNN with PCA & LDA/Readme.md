## Following are the operations performed inside the code file:
(Dataset used: Wine Quality Dataset [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality])

#### 1.	Effect of Normalization (Z-Score Normalization) on data using Scatter Plots
•	Pair Plot differences between Normalized and Un-Normalized Data

#### 2.	KNN Classifier with Normalized Data for Uniform, Manhattan and Euclidean Weight Schemes
•	Performance Analysis between all combinations

•	K- Plots for each scheme

#### 3.	Implemented PCA and checked the result of KNN classifier on same schemes.
•	Performance Analysis

•	K- Plots

#### 4.	Implemented LDA and checked the result of KNN Classifier on same schemes.
•	Performance Analysis

•	K-Plots

#### 5.	Data Analysis with only 2 PCA Component and 2 LDA Component Projected Data using Scatter Plots.
•	PC1 vs PC2 Analysis

•	LD1 vs LD2 Analysis

#### 6.	Final Comparison to show whether PCA or LDA yields better result with KNN Classifier for all 3 schemes.
#### 7.	Applied Feature Selection methods in order to obtain 4 best features from dataset:
•	Using Heat Map

•	Using Sequential Feature Detector
#### 8.	Applied KNN Classifier (after performing PCA and LDA of 4 best feature dataset) for all 3 schemes.
#### 9.	Analyzed the effect of PCA and LDA with Normalized and Un- Normalized Complete Dataset.
