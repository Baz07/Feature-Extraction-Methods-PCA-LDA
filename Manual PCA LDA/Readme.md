## Following are the operations perfomed under the code file:
(Dataset Used: DataB)

#### 1.	Performed Eigen Decomposition (Eigen Value and Vectors)
#### 2.	Eigen Values Scree Plot and cut off analysis
#### 3.	Plot the Projected Data with top 20 Eigen Values and its analysis.

## PCA Operations:
#### 4.	2D Representation of (PC1 vs PC2) and (PC5 vs PC6) and their comparison analysis.
#### 5.	PCA Implementation with SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
•	using library.

•	Manual Implementation (No Library)

#### 6.	Dual PCA Implementation with SVD (Without any library)

## LDA Operations:
#### 7.	LDA Implementation
•	Manual Implementation

•	Using “Sklearn” Library

#### 8.	Comparison between (PC1 vs PC2), (PC2 vs PC3), (PC3 vs PC4) and (LD1 vs LD2), (LD2 vs LD3), (LD3 vs LD4)
